        This project is a trial for the creation of a light novel compilation
        tool, through the use of web scraping. There is such a wide range of
        websites to comb through for light novels, as such it may be difficult
        to find the exact book you want to read. Through our website, we hope to
        make it easier to find the exact book that we want. We would also like
        to add functionality to discover books through search criteria such as
        genre, authors, or number of pages and chapters.
